== Intro

OpenMUC is a software framework based on Java and OSGi that simplifies
the development of customized monitoring, logging and control
systems. It can be used as a basis to flexibly implement anything from
simple data loggers to complex SCADA systems. The main goal of OpenMUC
is to shield the application developer of monitoring and control
applications from the details of the communication protocol and data
logging technologies. Third parties are encouraged to create their own
customized systems based on OpenMUC. OpenMUC is licensed under the
GPL. If you need an individual license please
link:https://www.openmuc.org/contact/[contact] us.

For a short overview of OpenMUC's goals and features please visit our
link:https://www.openmuc.org/openmuc/[overview page]. This guide is a
detailed documentation on how OpenMUC works and how to use it.


== Architecture

The following image depicts the software layers of an OpenMUC
system.

:img-file: openmuc-software-layers.png
image::{img-file}[title="OpenMUC software layers",width={width60}, link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

The OpenMUC framework runs within an OSGi environment which in turn is
being run by a Java Virtual Machine. The underlying operating system
and hardware can be chosen freely as long as it can run a Java 7 VM.

OpenMUC consists essentially of various software modules which are
implemented as OSGi bundles that run in the OSGi environment and
communicate over OSGi services. The following figure illustrates the
main modules that make up OpenMUC.

:img-file: openmuc-bundles-with-numbers.png
image::{img-file}[title="OpenMUC modules",width={width60}, link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

All modules except for the data manager are optional. Thus by
selecting the modules you need you can easily create your own
customized and lightweight system.

The different modules in the picture are now further explained:

. The *data manager* represents the core and center of
OpenMUC. Virtually all other OpenMUC modules (e.g. drivers, data
loggers, servers, applications and web interface plugins) communicate
with it through OSGi services. The data manager gets automatically
notified when new drivers or data loggers get installed. OpenMUC
applications communicate with devices, access logged data or change
the configuration by calling service functions provided by the data
manager. It is therefore the data manager that shields the application
programmer from the details of the communication and data logging
technology. What the data manager does is mostly controlled through a
central configuration.

. The *channel configuration* holds the user defined data channels and
its parameters. Data channels are the frameworks
representation of data points in connected devices. Amongst others the
channel configuration holds the following information:
+
--

	     .. communication parameters that the drivers require

	     .. when to sample new data from connected devices

	     .. when to send sampled data to existing data logger(s)
for efficient persistent storage.

The configuration is stored in the file
conf/channels.xml. You may add or modify the configured channels by
manually editing the channels.xml file or through the channel
configurator web interface.
--

. A *driver* is used by the data manager to send/get data to/from a
connected device. Thus a driver usually implements a communication
protocol. Several communication drivers have already been developed
(e.g. IEC 61850, ModbusTCP, KNX, DLMS/COSEM). Many drivers use
standalone communication libraries (e.g. OpenIEC61850, jMBus)
developed by the OpenMUC team. These libraries do not depend on the
OpenMUC framework and can therefore be used by any Java
application. New communication drivers for OpenMUC can be easily
developed by third parties.

. A *data logger* saves sampled data persistently. The data manager
forwards sampled data to all available data loggers if configured to
do so. Data loggers are specifically designed to store time series
data for short storage and retrieval times. Note that this usually
means that they are not SQL-based. OpenMUC currently includes two data
loggers. The ASCII data logger saves data in a human readable text
format while SlotsDB saves data in a more efficient binary format.

. If all you want is sample and log data then you can use the OpenMUC
framework as it is and simply configure it to your needs. But if you
want to process sampled data or control a device you will want to
write your own *application*. Like all other modules your application
will be an OSGi bundle. In your application you can use the
DataAccessService and the ConfigService provided by the data manager
to access sampled and logged data. You may also issue immediate read
or write commands. These are forwarded by the data manager to the
driver. The configuration (when to sample and to log) can also be
changed during run-time by the application. At all times the
application only communicates with the data manager and is therefore
not confronted with the complicated details of the communication
technology being used.

. If your application is located on a remote system (e.g. a smart
phone or an Internet server) then the data and configuration can be
accessed through an OpenMUC *server*. At the moment OpenMUC provides a
RESTful web service for this purpose.

. Finally the OpenMUC framework provides a web user interface
(*WebUI*) for tasks such as configuration, visualization of sampled
data or exporting logged data. The web interface is modular and
provides a plug-in interface. This way developers may write a website
that integrates into the main menu of the web interface. The WebUI is
mostly for configuration and testing purposes. Most companies will
want to create their own individual UI.






== Quick Start

This chapter will give you an idea of how OpenMUC works by showing you
how to run and adjust the demo framework which is part of the OpenMUC
distribution. OpenMUC requires Java 7 or higher, therefore make sure
it is installed on your machine.

=== Framework Files

The folder "framework" contains a configured OpenMUC framework that
can be used as a basis to create your own customized OpenMUC framework
for your task. The framework folder contains the following important
files and folders:

felix::

    The main Apache Felix OSGi jar which is run to start OpenMUC.

bin::

    Run scripts for Linux/Unix and Windows.

bundle::

    Contains all bundles that are started by the Felix OSGi
    framework. Note that this folder does not contain all available
    OpenMUC bundles but only a subset for demonstration purposes.

log::

    Log files produced by the running framework.

conf::

    Various configuration files of the framework.



=== Starting the Demo

First open a terminal and go to the folder named "framework".

To start OpenMUC on Linux run:

----
./bin/openmuc start -fg
----

To start OpenMUC on Window run:

----
bin\openmuc.bat
----

This will start the Apache Felix OSGi framework which in turn starts
all the bundles located in the "bundle" folder. Among the bundles that
are started is the Apache Gogo shell. This shell is entered once you
run OpenMUC.

The shell can be used to start, stop, and reload bundles among other
things. You can stop and exit the OSGi framework any time by typing "ctrl+d"
or "stop 0".


Now type "lb" to list all installed bundles.

You will see that among the active bundles are the Simple Demo App,
the OpenMUC core bundles, two data loggers (ASCII and SlotsDB) as well
as the CSV driver.

=== Configuration

One of the most important configuration files is
conf/channels.xml. This file tells the OpenMUC Data Manager which data
it shall sample, listen for, and log. This is done by configuring so
called channels. Each channel represents a single data point whose
value can be an integer, double, string or byte array.

The demo's channels.xml configures among others channels whose values
are read by the CSV driver. The channels are sampled/read and logged
every 5 seconds.

For more information about the channels.xml see the <<anchor-configuration,configuration>> chapter.

=== Simple Demo App

The simple demo app demonstrates how you can access channels and
their records from an application. The app reads data from channels of
the CSV driver, calculates new values from them and writes them to
other channels. The app can be used as starting point to create your
own OpenMUC application.


=== WebUI Walk Through

This section leads you through the framework's WebUI.

Open a browser (works currently best with Google Chrome) and enter the
URL "http://localhost:8888". This leads you to the login page. The
default user is _admin_ and the default password is _admin_ as well.

After successful login the OpenMUC Dashboard opens, which provides
various plugins for configuration and visualization. A full
description of the plugins can be found in the chapter
<<anchor-web-ui,Web UI>>.

Let us first look at the Channel Access Tool which provides the
current value of each channel and also enables you to write
values. Click on Channel Access Tool to open this plugin. The next
page lists all available devices which are currently configured in
OpenMUC. Select the _home1_ and proceed with _Access selected_.

:img-file: webui-channelaccesstool-device-selection.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI device selection",width={width60},link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

On the next page you will see the latest records of all channels of
home1. Each record consists of a data value, a timestamp when it was
sampled and a quality flag.

:img-file: webui-channelaccesstool-channels.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI channel access tool",width={width60},link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

Let's have look at the _Data Plotter_. To get to the _Data Plotter_
click on _Applications_ next to the OpenMUC logo and select __Data
Plotter__.

:img-file: webui-dataplotter.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI data plotter",width={width60},link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

Select the _Live_ Data Plotter. To view the live data select the channels of your choice and
click _Plot Data_.

:img-file: webui-dataplotter-live.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI live plotter",width={width60},link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]


==== Add a New Channel

All channels currently defined get their data using the CSV driver
from the file "csv-driver/home1.csv". That file contains additional
data. So let us now add a new channel to the OpenMUC configuration
using the channel scan feature.

In the WebUI go to the Channel Configurator. Click the tab
"Devices". In the row of device "home1" click on the search/scan
icon. It shows you all the channels available in that device. Once the
scan has completed a list of available channels is shown. In this
tutorial we select the channel with address
"pv_energy_production". Click "add channels".

Now the channel overview opens where we can find our selected
channel. In the last step of the configuration we click on the edit
icon of the channel and set the parameters _logging interval_ and
_sampling interval_ to 5000 ms and change the unit to kWh.

You can now check that the new channel was added to the
"conf/channels.xml" file.

After submitting the channel configuration we go back to the dashboard
and open the Channel Access Tool. Here we select our home1 device and
continue with _access selected_. Now we able to see the current values
of the pv_energy_production channel.

The logged data can be found in
_openmuc/framework/data/ascii/<currentdate>_5000.dat_


== Tutorial - Simple M-Bus Data Logger

*Objective:* You will learn how to create a simple data logger which reads out a M-Bus meter via serial communication. It uses OpenMUC on-board tools so no programming is required.

*Preparation:* If not already done, your system needs to be prepared once for serial communication.

----
sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
sudo adduser $USER dialout
----

Now logout from your system and login again to apply system changes.

*Step-by-step*

. Download OpenMUC and unpack it

. Open openmuc/framework/conf/bundles.conf.gradle and comment the following lines by //
+
----
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-app-simpledemo", version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework", name: "openmuc-driver-csv", version: openmucVersion
----

. Add following lines to make the M-Bus driver and serial communication available
+
----
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc.framework" name: "openmuc-driver-mbus", version: openmucVersion
osgibundles group: "org.openmuc", name: "jrxtx", version: "1.0.1"
----

. To apply changes navigate to openmuc/framework/bin and run
+
----
./openmuc update-bundles
----

. Start OpenMUC
+
----
./openmuc start -fg
----

. Open a browser and point it to localhost:8888 to view the WebUI of OpenMUC. Login with user _admin_ and password _admin_.

. Click on _Channel Configurator_ > _Tab Drivers_ > _Add new driver to configuration_

. Enter _mbus_ as ID and click Submit

. Now the M-Bus driver appears under _Channel Configurator_ > _Tab Drivers_. Click on the search icon

. Enter the serial port the meter is connected to and provide the baud rate if needed (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS0:2400). See M-Bus driver section for more information.

. Click on _Scan for devices_. Now OpenMUC scans all M-Bus addresses, which may take a while

. Select the desired device from the list and click _Add devices_
+
:img-file: tutorial_mbus_logger_driver_scan.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI M-Bus device scan",width=400,link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

. Now the device is added. If you do not see the search icon next to the device, press F5 to reload the page and navigate to _Channel Configurator_ > _Tab Devices_

. Click on the search icon and OpenMUC automatically scans all available channels. Select the desired channels and click _Add channels_
+
:img-file: tutorial_mbus_logger_channel_scan.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI M-Bus channel scan",width=400,link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

. Now we need to define a sampling and logging interval for the channels. Click on _Channel Configurator_ > _Tab Channels_ and click on _Edit Icon_ of the desired channel. Write _2000_ in the _Sampling Interval_ and _Logging Interval_ field and click Submit

. To show actual values of the channel, navigate to _Applications_ > _Channel Access Tool_, select your device and click _Access selected_
+
:img-file: tutorial_mbus_logger_channel_access_tool.png
image::{img-file}[title="WebUI channel access tool",width=400,link="{imagesdir}/{img-file}"]

*Tips*

* All logged data are stored in /openmuc/framework/data/ascii/
* You can also change the configuration by editing /openmuc/framework/conf/channels.xml


== Distribution

The distribution contains the following important files and folders:

build/libs-all::

    All modules/bundles that make up the OpenMUC framework

dependencies::

    Information on the external dependencies of the OpenMUC
    framework. Also contains the RXTX library (repacked as a bundle)
    which is needed by many OpenMUC drivers based on serial
    communication.

projects::

    All sources of the OpenMUC framework. You can easily change and
    rebuild OpenMUC using Gradle.

framework::

    A ready to use OpenMUC demo framework that is introduced next.


== Running OpenMUC

To start OpenMUC on Linux run:

----
./bin/openmuc start
----

This runs OpenMUC as a background process. If you want to run OpenMUC
in the foreground run:

----
./bin/openmuc start -fg
----

To start OpenMUC under Window run:

----
bin\openmuc.bat
----

The Linux start script is a sophisticated bash script that can be used
to start, stop, restart OpenMUC. The Windows run script is a simple
bat file that starts OpenMUC. The following explanations will focus on
using OpenMUC in a Linux environment as it is the more common
scenario.

Starting OpenMUC really means running the Felix OSGi Framework by
executing

java -jar felix/felix.jar

The Felix OSGi Framework will then start all bundles located in the
"bundle" folder.

When you start OpenMUC in the foreground you will enter the Felix Gogo
shell. From the shell you can start, stop and reload bundles among
many other things. To quit the shell and stop the framework press
ctrl+d or enter "stop 0".

If OpenMUC was started as a background process you can access the Gogo
shell using telnet:

----
netcat 127.0.0.1 6666
----

or using the openmuc run script

----
./bin/openmuc remote-shell
----

Pressing ctrl+d will exit the remote shell but not stop the openmuc framework.

To stop OpenMUC run:

----
./bin/openmuc stop
----

=== Auto-start at Boot Time

On Debian based Linux distributions it is easy to configure automatic
start of OpenMUC at boot time. As root execute the following commands:

----
ln -s /path/to/openmuc/bin/openmuc /etc/init.d/openmuc
update-rc.d openmuc defaults
----

The above solution will not work if the openmuc start script is
located on a partion that is not yet mounted at the time the boot
process attempts to open it. In this case you need copy the start
script to /etc/init.d/ and edit it to set the OPENMUC_HOME variable.

== Install a Driver

When you want to use a new driver you have to copy the corresponding
jar file from the folder "build/libs-all/" to the "bundle" folder of
the framework. Many drivers are "fat jars" which include their
dependencies. An exception is the RXTX library which cannot be packed
with the jars.


=== Use a Driver with Serial Communication

When you need to use a driver that uses serial communication you have
to copy the RXTX bundle to the frameworks "bundle" folder.

----
cp ../dependencies/rxtx/rxtxcomm_api-2.2pre2.jar ./bundle/
----

Additionally you need to install librxtx-java:

----
sudo apt-get install librxtx-java
----

The serial ports /dev/tty* are only accessible to members belonging to
the group dialout. We therefore have to add our user to that
group. E.g. using:

----
sudo adduser <yourUserName> dialout
----



== Devices and Channels

OpenMUC works on the basis of channels. A channel basically represents
a single data point. Some examples for a channel are the metered
active power of a smart meter, the temperature of a temperature
sensor, any value of digital or analog I/O module or the some
manufacture data of the device. Thus a channel can represent any kind
of data point. The following picture illustrates the channel concept.

.OpenMUCs Channel Concept

[[anchor-configuration]]
=== Configuration

The *conf/channels.xml* file is the main configuration file for
OpenMUC. It tells the OpenMUC framework which channels it should log
and sample. It contains a hierarchical structure of drivers, devices
and channels. A driver can have one or more devices and devices can
have one or more channels. Following listing shows a sample
configuration to illustrate the hierarchical structure. The driver,
device and channel options are explained afterwards.

.channels.xml structure
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<configuration>
	<logger>loggerId</logger>

	<driver id="driver_x">
		<!-- driver options -->
		<device>
			<!-- device options -->
			<channel>
				<!-- channel options -->
			</channel>
			<channel>
				<!-- channel options -->
			</channel>
		</device>
	</driver>
</configuration>
----

.*Driver options*
[width="100%",cols="2,1,1,1,4",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Options | Mandatory | Values | Default | Description

|id| yes | _string_ | - | Id of the driver

|samplingTimeout| no | time* | 0 | Default time waited for a read operation to complete if the device doesn't set a samplingTimeout on its own.

|connectRetryInterval| no | time* | 60s | Default time waited until a failed connection attempt is repeated.

|disabled| no | _boolean_| false | While disabled, no connections to devices on this driver are established at all and all channels of these devices stop being sampled and logged.
|=========================================================

.*Device options*

[width="100%",cols="2,1,1,1,4",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Options | Mandatory | Values | Default | Description

|id| no | _string_ | - | ID of the device.

|deviceAddress| yes | _string_ | - | Address for the driver to uniquely identify the device. Syntax of this address is up to the driver implementation.

|description| no | _string_ | - | Description of the device.

|settings| no | _string_ | - | Additional settings for the driver. Syntax is up to the driver implementation.

|samplingTimeout| no | time* | 0 | Time waited for a read operation to complete. Overwrites samplingTimeout of Driver.

|connectRetryInterval| no | time* | 60s | Time waited until a failed connection attempt is repeated.

|disabled| no | _boolean_ | false | While disabled, no connection of this device is established and all channels of this device stop being sampled and logged.
|=========================================================

.*Channel options*

[width="100%",cols="2,1,1,1,4",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Options | Mandatory | Values | Default | Description

|id| yes | _string_ | - | Globally unique identifier. Used by data logger implementations. The OpenMUC framework automatically generates an id if none is provided.

|description| no | _string_ | - | Description of the channel.

|channelAddress| yes | _string_ | - | The channelAddress is driver specific and contains the necessary parameters for the driver to access.

|valueType| no | DOUBLE  FLOAT  LONG  INTEGER  SHORT  BYTE  BOOLEAN  BYTE_ARRAY STRING| DOUBLE | Data type of the channel. Used on data logger. Driver implementation do NOT receive this settings!
|valueType Attribute: _length_| no | _integer_ | 10 | The attribute _length_ is only used if valueType is BYTE_ARRAY or STRING. Determines the maximum length of the byte array or string.

|scalingFactor| no | _double_ | 1 | Is used to scale a value read by a driver or set by an application. The value read by an driver is multiplied with the scalingFactor and a value set by an application is divided by the scalingFactor. Possible values are e.g.: 1.0 4.94147E-9 -2.4

|valueOffset| no | _double_ | 0 | Is used to offset a value read by a driver or set by an application. The offset is added to a value read by a driver and subtracted from a value set by an application.

|unit| no | _string_ | - | Physical unit of this channel. For information only (info can be accessed by an app or driver)

|loggingInterval| no | time* | - | Time difference until this channel is logged again. -1 or omitting loggingInterval disables logging.

|disabled| no | _boolean_ | false | If a channel is disabled, all sampling and logging actions of this channel are stopped.
|=========================================================
*$$*$$time: integer with suffix (ms, s, m, h) like: 300ms, 2s.*

NOTE: *if you don't use a suffix, then ms is automatically used*


The available driver settings, device settings and channel settings
can also be found in the
link:https://www.openmuc.org/openmuc/javadoc/[Javadoc] of
DriverConfig.java, DeviceConfig.java and ChannelConfig.java
respectively.


*Default Data Logger*

You can define a default data logger by adding a logger element with
the id of a data logger to the configuration. If available, that data
logger is used to read logged values. The ids of data loggers shipped
with the OpenMUC Framework are defined in the "Data Loggers"
chapter. If no logger with the defined id is available, or the logger
element is missing from the configuration, an arbitrary available
logger is used to read logged values. Only one default logger may be
defined. If multiple logger elements exists, only the first one is
evaluated.

This configuration only affects reading of already logged
values. Channels are still logged by all available loggers.

=== Sampling, Listening and Logging

* *sampling* is when the data manager frequently asks a driver to
   retrieve a channel value.

* *listening* is when the driver listens on a channel and forwards new
   values to the data manager.

* *logging* is when the data manager forwards the current sampled
   value to the data loggers that are installed. The data loggers then
   store the data persistently

The following examples will give you a better understanding of these
three settings.

.Example 1: Just Sampling
[source,xml]
----
<channel>
	<id>channel1</id>
	<channelAddress>dummy/channel/address/1</channelAddress>
	<samplingInterval>4s</samplingInterval>
</channel>
----

In example 1 the channel is sampled every 4 seconds which means the
data manager requests every 4 seconds the current value from the
driver.

.Example 2: Sampling and Logging
[source,xml]
----
<channel>
	<id>channel2</id>
	<channelAddress>dummy/channel/address/2</channelAddress>
	<samplingInterval>4s</samplingInterval>
	<loggingInterval>8s</loggingInterval>
</channel>
----

Example 2 extends example 1 by an additional logging. The logging
interval is set to 8 seconds which means that every 8 seconds the last
sampled value is stored in the database. In this case every second
sampled value is stored because the sampling interval is 4 seconds. To
log every sampled value the sampling interval and logging interval
need to be the same.

.Example 3: Just Listening
[source,xml]
----
<channel>
	<id>channel3</id>
	<channelAddress>dummy/channel/address/3</channelAddress>
	<listening>true</listening>
</channel>
----
In example 3 listening instead of sampling is used. This means that the driver reports a new channel value to the data manager when the value has changed for example.

.Example 4: Listening and Logging
[source,xml]
----
 <channel>
	<id>channel4</id>
	<channelAddress>dummy/channel/address/4</channelAddress>
	<listening>true</listening>
	<loggingInterval>8s</loggingInterval>
</channel>
----
Example 4 extends example 3 by an additional logging.

IMPORTANT: When listening is true and additional a sampling interval is defined then the sampling is ignored.

[[anchor-web-ui]]
== The WebUI

=== Plugins

Plotter::

Plugin which provides plotter for visualisation of current and historical data

Channel Access Tool::

Plugin to show current values of selected channels. Provides possibility to set values.

Channel Configurator::

Plugin for channel configuration e.g. channel name, sampling interval, logging interval

Media Viewer::

Plugin which allows to embed media files into OpenMUC's WebUI

User Configurator::

Plugin for user configuration

=== HTTPS

You can access the WebUI over https as well:
https://localhost:8889. To make the framework more secure you could
disable http by setting org.apache.felix.http.enable in the
conf/system.properties file to false.


[[id_restful_web_services]]
== REST Server

The openmuc-server-restws bundle manages a RESTful web service to access all registered channels of the framework. The RESTful web service is accessed by the same port as the web interface mentioned in Chapter 2.

TIP: The address to access the web service using the provided demo/framework folder is 'http://localhost:8888/rest/'

=== Requirements


In order to start the RESTful web service, the following bundle must be provided:

 - Bundle that provides an org.osgi.service.http.HttpService service. In the demo framework, that service is provided by the org.apache.felix.http.jetty bundle.

This bundles is already provided by the demo framework. The RESTful web service will start automatically with the framework without additional settings.

=== Accessing channels


The latest record of a single channel can be accessed, by sending a
GET request at the address:
'http://server-address/rest/channels/\{id\}' where \{id\} is replaced
with the actual channel ID. The result will be latest record object of
the channel encoded in JSON with the following structure:

.Record JSON
[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp" : time_val, /*milliseconds since Unix epoch*/
  "flag" : flag_val,      /*status flag of the record as string*/
  "value" : value_val     /*actual value. Omitted if "flag" != "valid"*/
}
----

You can access logged values of a channel by adding
'/history?from=fromTimestamp&until=untilTimestamp' to the channel
address, fromTimestamp and untilTimestamp are both milliseconds since
Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00). The result is a collection of
records encoded as JSON.

Additionally, the records off all available channels can be read in one
go, by omitting the ID from the address. The result is a collection of
channel objects encoded in JSON using this structure:

.ChannelCollection JSON
[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"id" : channel1_id,  /*ID of the channel as string*/
		"record" : channel1_record /*current record. see Record JSON*/
	},
	{
		"id" : channel2_id,
		"record" : channel2_record
	}
	...
]
----

New records can be written to channels by sending a PUT request at the
address that represents a channel. The data in the put request is a
record encoded as specified in Record JSON above.

If HTTPS is used to access the REST server then HTTP basic
authentication is required. The login credentials are the same as the
one used to log into the web interface of the OpenMUC Framework.

[[id_modbus_service]]
== Modbus Server
The modus service allows you to access to a OpenMUC channel by ModbusTCP protocol.
For accessing a channel through Modbus the channel has to be mapped with
_serverMapping_ and the Modbus Server bundle has to copied in the bundle folder.
