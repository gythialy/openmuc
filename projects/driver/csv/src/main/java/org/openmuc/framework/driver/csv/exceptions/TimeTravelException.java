 * Exception for illogical time jumps. <br>

 * Scenario 1: the csv file contains ONLY values within a time period form 100000 o'clock till 110000 o'clock. The
 * driver has successfully sampled a value within this period. Now the time has jumped and the next sampling time is
 * 090000 o'clock (so before the first entry of the csv file). The driver therefore can't find a value for this sampling
 * time.
