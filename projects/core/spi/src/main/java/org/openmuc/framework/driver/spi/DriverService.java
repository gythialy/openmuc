/**
 * 
 * The <code>DriverService</code> is the interface that all OpenMUC communication drivers have to implement and register
 * as a service in the OSGi environment. The OpenMUC Core Data Manager tracks this service and will therefore be
 * automatically notified of any new drivers in the framework. If sampling, listening or logging has been configured for
 * this driver, then the data manager will start right away with the appropriate actions.
 * 
 * A driver often implements a communication protocol but could also get its data from any other source (e.g. a file).
 * 
 * Some guidelines should be followed when implementing a driver for OpenMUC:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Logging may only be done with level <code>debug</code> or <code>trace</code>. Even these debug messages should be
 * used very sparsely. Only use them to further explain errors that occur.</li>
 * <li>If the connection to a device is interrupted throw a <code>ConnectionException</code>. The framework will then
 * try to reconnect by calling the <code>connect</code> function.</li>
 * <li>All unchecked exceptions thrown by the <code>DriverService</code> are caught by the OpenMUC framework and logged
 * with level <code>error</code>. It is bad practice to throw these unchecked exceptions because they can clutter the
 * log file and slow down performance if the function is called many times. Instead the appropriate Flag should be
 * returned for the affected channels.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
