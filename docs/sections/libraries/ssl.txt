*Key/Trust Store*

To get the certificates of a server one can easily use a browser and click on the lock sign next to the URL to download it.
Alternatively on *nix one can use the tool openssl:
[source]
openssl s_client -connect host:port -showcerts [-proxy host:port]

Copy the needed certificates into a file i.e. `cert.crt` (beginning with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` ending with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. Add them to the store:
[source]
keytool -keystore conf/truststore.jks -importcert cert.crt

The default password is `changeme`. We want to change that:
[source]
keytool -keystore conf/truststore.jks -storepasswd

You can also import certificates from another store. Prefer importing over just using the other store directly as the store type needs to be `PKCS#12`.
[source]
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore otherstore.jks -destkeystore conf/truststore.jks

Editing `conf/keystore.jks` is done analog to the Trust Store.

Edit `/conf/system.properties` to reflect the changes:
[source]
----
org.openmuc.framework.truststore = conf/truststore.jks
org.openmuc.framework.keystore = conf/keystore.jks
org.openmuc.framework.truststorepassword = changeme
org.openmuc.framework.keystorepassword = changeme
