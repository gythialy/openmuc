=== Parser-Service

The Parser-Service is part of the OpenMUC core SPI bundle and provides methods to serialize and deserialize
OpenMUC records. It is used by the MQTT and AMQP logger but can be also used inside OpenMUC drivers and applications.

==== Accessing a specific Parser-Service

Bundles implementing the ParserService interface (like the OpenMUC-Parser see below) registering their parserID at the
OSGi service registry. The following code describes, how a Parser-Service and its ID can be accessed. The given
parserID makes it possible to identify the concrete implementation, e.g. "openmuc". Therefore is the instance
of the given BundleContext needed.

[source,xml]
----
String serviceInterfaceName = ParserService.class.getName();
ServiceReference<?> serviceReference = bundleContext.getServiceReference(serviceInterfaceName);

if (serviceReference != null) {
    String parserId = (String) serviceReference.getProperty("parserID");
    ParserService parser = (ParserService) bundleContext.getService(serviceReference);
}
----

Alternatively it's possible to import and instantiate a Parser-Implementation over the java classpath.
But this increases the dependencies of your bundle and prevents the advantages of OSGi.

A more complex example with event based registration can be found in the implementation of the MQTT logger.

==== OpenMUC-Parser

The default OpenMUC-Parser is provided in the openmuc-lib-parser-openmuc project. It implements the
ParserService-Interface for serialisation and deserialisation of OpenMUC Records. This services is provided and
can be accessed over the OSGi service registry as shown in the section before.
It registers its service with the value "openmuc" for the property "parserID".
The serialized message is represented in JSON with the following format.

[source,xml]
----
{"timestamp":1587974340000,"flag":"VALID","value":6.67}

==== Custom Parser

For adding a custom parser to OpenMUC, the ParserService-Interface from the SPI-Project has to be implemented. After
this the implementation must be registered in the OSGi service registry. Therefore use the given instance of your
BundleContext.

[source,xml]
----
@Activate
public void activate(BundleContext context) {
    Dictionary<String, Object> properties = new Hashtable<>();
    properties.put("parserID", "<myCustomParser>");

    String serviceName = ParserService.class.getName();

    registration = context.registerService(serviceName, new MyParserServiceImpl(), properties);
}
