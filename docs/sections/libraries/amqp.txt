=== AMQP
[#amqp-lib]
The AMQP library uses the RabbitMQ Java Client to connect to the broker.

The library consists of four classes:

* AmqpSettings
* AmqpConnection
* AmqpReader
* AmqpWriter

It implements automatic connection recovery with message buffering.
If only publishing (or consuming) is needed only the AmqpConnection and the AmqpReader (or AmqpWriter) needs to be instantiated.

==== Connecting to a broker (AmqpSettings/AmqpConnection)

An instance of an AmqpConnection represents a connection to a broker. If multiple connections are needed one can simply create multiple instances.

To create an AmqpConnection instance one first needs to create an instance of AmqpSettings and pass it to the constructor of the AmqpConnection. In 
that way, it is up to the developer to decide where to get the connection properties from.

The connection to the broker is going to be created as soon as the constructor of AmqpConnection is executed.

Declaring any queues is not needed as AmqpReader and AmqpWriter do this already.

Before the application stops one should `disconnect()` first to clean up any resources.

Example with local RabbitMQ Broker:

```java
String host = "localhost";
int port = 5672;
String virtualHost = "/";
String username = "guest";
String password = "guest";
boolean ssl = false;
String exchange = "example";

AmqpSettings settings = new AmqpSettings(
    host, port, virtualHost, username, password, ssl, exchange
);

AmqpConnection connection = new AmqpConnection(settings);

// Before stopping the application:
connection.disconnect();
```

==== Consuming messages (AmqpReader)

To consume messages from the broker one has two options:

===== Manually retrieving messages

This is the simplest way to get a message. The method `byte[] read(String queue)` returns a single message retrieved from the given queue or `null` if the queue was empty.

Example:

```java
AmqpReader reader = new AmqpReader(connection);
byte[] receivedMessage = reader.read("exampleQueue");

if (receivedMessage == null) {
    // No message received
} else {
    // Handle received message
}
```

===== Listening for messages

This is the recommended way to receive messages, as the messages are received in the moment the broker receives them. One can listen to a collection of queues with a 
listener which gets notified when a message in any of those queues is received. When listening to a single queue just pass a collection singleton.

Example:

```java
AmqpReader reader = new AmqpReader(connection);
Collection<String> queues = new ArrayList<>(2);
queues.add("exampleQueue1");
queues.add("exampleQueue2");

reader.listen(queues, (String queue, byte[] message) -> {
    if (queue == "exampleQueue1") {
        // handle message
    } else {
        // handle message
    }
});
```

==== Publishing messages (AmqpWriter)

To publish a message call `void write(String routingKey, byte[] message)` with the routing key and the message. The message will be published to the exchange specified 
in the AmqpConnection.

Example:

```java
AmqpWriter writer = new AmqpWriter(connection);

String routingKey = "test.logger";
byte[] message = "Hello World!".getBytes();
writer.write(routingKey, message);
```
